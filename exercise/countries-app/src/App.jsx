/*
key={index}: The key prop is required by React when rendering lists of elements. It helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. Here, weâ€™re using the index as the key, which is the position of the country in the array (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.). Using index as a key is fine for small, static lists.
*/

/*
className="country": This assigns a CSS class name (country) to the <li> element, allowing us to apply specific styles to it. In React, you use className instead of class to avoid conflicts with the JavaScript class keyword.
